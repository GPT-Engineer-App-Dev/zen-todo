# zen-todo

Implement a basic todo app with the following features:

- An input field and button to add new todo items
- A list showing existing todo items. Each item should show the todo text.
- A way to mark todo items as completed. Completed items should be visually distinguished, for example with a checkmark or strikethrough.
- A button to delete each todo item.

For now, the todo items don't need to be persisted between page refreshes. We can start with just storing them in memory.

Use Chakra UI components where appropriate to make the UI look nice.
