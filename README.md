# zen-todo

Please create a basic todo app with the following features:

- A header with the app name "My Todos" 
- An input field to add new todos. Pressing Enter in this field should add the todo.
- A list showing existing todos
- Each todo should show the todo text, a checkbox to mark it as completed, an edit button, and a delete button
- Checking the checkbox should mark the todo as completed (strike-through text)
- Clicking the edit button should allow editing the todo text
- Clicking the delete button should remove the todo 
- Completed todos should appear at the bottom of the list
- The list of todos should be stored in localStorage so they persist on page reload

You can use a simple unstyled UI for now, we'll improve the design in future iterations. The key thing is to get the basic functionality in place.
